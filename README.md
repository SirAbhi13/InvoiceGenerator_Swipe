Swipe Invoice Generator

- Used the given code as an template to create other components.


### Problems encountered while making this project
- Tried to implement implement Store subscription to update Invoices whenever Product Values are changed, but couldn't make it work, current implementation is buggy as it just dispatches a method to update invoice total upon product change.
- Implemented the categories in invoice creation using hard coding the categories and using filter to only provide products of that category, but it didn't work out since the item fields were being replicated everywhere.
